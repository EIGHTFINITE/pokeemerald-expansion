/*
Teaching Types are not used directly by the ROM but they are used by
make_teachables.py to generate teachable learnsets. To save ROM space, the info is 
stored in 1 bit and the python script reads the name of the define.
This means we can have multiple "modes" that define to 1.
You can add additional teaching types but they would need to be described in the
python script.
