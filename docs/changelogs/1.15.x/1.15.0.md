* Allow Starting Statuses beyond 15 by @AsparagusEduardo in [#8485](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/8485)
    - You may now define if a Trainer's starting status is temporary or not, by adding "Temporary" at the end (eg. "Electric Terrain Temporary")
    - `B_VAR_STARTING_STATUS` and `B_VAR_STARTING_STATUS_TIMER` have been replaced with `setstartingstatus` and the timer functionality has been removed in favor of defining temporary and permanent versions of each starting status. Eg.
    ```
    setvar B_VAR_STARTING_STATUS STARTING_STATUS_PSYCHIC_TERRAIN | STARTING_STATUS_RAINBOW_OPPONENT
    setvar B_VAR_STARTING_STATUS_TIMER 5
    ```
    has been replaced with
    ```
    setstartingstatus STATUS_PSYCHIC_TERRAIN_TEMPORARY
    setstartingstatus STARTING_STATUS_RAINBOW_OPPONENT
    ```
    They can be stacked on top of each other.

* Counter/Mirror Coat/Metal Burst refactor by @PhallenTree in [#8604](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/8604)
    - `EFFECT_COUNTER`, `EFFECT_MIRROR_COAT` and `EFFECT_METAL_BURST` have been combined into `EFFECT_REFLECT_DAMAGE`
    - These now use `BattleScript_EffectHit` and their damage is calculated in `DoFixedDamageMoveCalc`

    - `src/data/pokemon/teachable_learnsets.h` has been removed from the repo
    - If your config P_LEARNSET_HELPER_TEACHABLE is set to false, open your `.gitignore` file and remove the `src/data/pokemon/teachable_learnsets.h` line, commit your `.gitignore` and `src/data/pokemon/teachable_learnsets.h` files then continue like before.
    - If your config P_LEARNSET_HELPER_TEACHABLE is set to true, it will be created again when you use `make`. Documentation about the way the file is generated can be found in `docs/tutorials/teachable_learnsets.md`. Also the file `src/data/pokemon/all_learnables.json` is now replacing the porymoves files as the proper way to edit teachables sets. To your old teachables sets, run `make clean-teachables` and the file will be recreated based on the porymoves files when you run `make`

    - Synchronize and Cute Charm update: both of these overworld abilities now better match their cartridge behavior in regards to which pokemon are affected by the effect (use the `OW_SYNCHRONIZE_NATURE` config to choose the version) and can be more easily customized by changing the data in `src/ow_synchronize.c`
    - OW_SYNCHRONIZE_NATURE now defaults to GEN_LATEST(gen 9) where Synchronize has no overworld effect

    - WARNING: In Game trade have been modified and previous script might be broken, we recommend replacing you trade script by using the new macro
    - Add a new macro for ingame trade: `ingame_trade tradeId:req wantTradeMsg:req, declineTradeJump:req, wrongMonJump:req, tradeCompleteMsg:req`
    - Add a new macro for move tutor: `move_tutor moveId:req, wantTeachingMsg:req, monSelectMsg:req, declinedJmp:req, taughtJmp:req, flagId=0`. flagId is optional, if it is present the move tutor can only be used once (it checks if the flag is unset and sets the flag after teaching the move). If it is not present, the move tutor can be used as many times as you want
    - Adds a new config `OW_CHOOSE_FROM_PC_AND_PARTY` inc `cofig/overworld.h` to select if you want npc (daycare, move tutors, trade npc, ...) to let you pick a pokemon from the storage system (pc boxes+party) or just the party (defaults to TRUE allowing to choose mon from pc boxes
    - Adds a filter to show which mons are valid when picking a mon from PC
* Even more battle environment updates by @fdeblasio in [#8835](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/8835)
* Adds CancelerSetTargets and improves Pre Attack Effects by @PhallenTree in [#9178](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/9178)
    - Setting targets for moves has been refactored:
    - `gBattleStruct->battlerState[gBattlerAttacker]->targetsDone[target]` is set to `TRUE` if `target` isn't targeted by the move;
    - Moves now properly check failures against all targets when applicable. If it fails for all targets, it plays the same battle script as before; if it fails for some but not all targets, it will say "It doesn't affect target!", similar to Synchronoise.
    - Additional effects that occur before the move animation (like Brick Break, Spectral Thief), can now be applied to multiple targets and can have a chance to activate.
* Sky Drop Fixes/Refactor by @AlexOn1ine in [#9185](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/9185)

    - Added a new script that deletes all FRLG maps, just run `python dev_scripts/delete_frlg_maps.py`. It should take care of all the map constants but you will need to fix mention the to fuschia city entrance in the safari_zone.inc script. This does not save ROM space and is only useful to clean your repo

### Changed

    - `B_VAR_STARTING_STATUS` and `B_VAR_STARTING_STATUS_TIMER` have been replaced with `setstartingstatus` and the timer functionality has been removed in favor of defining temporary and permanent versions of each starting status. Eg.
    ```
    setvar B_VAR_STARTING_STATUS STARTING_STATUS_PSYCHIC_TERRAIN | STARTING_STATUS_RAINBOW_OPPONENT
    setvar B_VAR_STARTING_STATUS_TIMER 5
    ```
    has been replaced with
    ```

* Fix battle tutorial crashing after reshow in frlg by @FosterProgramming in [#9243](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/9243)
* Make .party files use "enum Pokeball" instead of "enum Item" by @FosterProgramming in [#9159](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/9159)
    - Balls data in trainers.party and battle_partners.party now expect enum Pokeball instead of struct Item
    - The "BALL_" prefix is automatically added just like "ITEM_" used to be be, it means "great ball" must become "great" or "love ball" must become "love"
    - running the migration script `python3 migration_scripts/1.15/trainer_party_ball_type_change.py` should change your files to the proper structure. If you have ball items not present in expansion in your project, you may need to edit the item_to_ball array in `migration_scripts/1.15/trainer_party_ball_type_change.py` to run the script

* Counter/Mirror Coat/Metal Burst refactor by @PhallenTree in [#8604](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/8604)
    - `EFFECT_COUNTER`, `EFFECT_MIRROR_COAT` and `EFFECT_METAL_BURST` have been combined into `EFFECT_REFLECT_DAMAGE`
    - These now use `BattleScript_EffectHit` and their damage is calculated in `DoFixedDamageMoveCalc`

    - Setting targets for moves has been refactored:
    - `gBattleStruct->battlerState[gBattlerAttacker]->targetsDone[target]` is set to `TRUE` if `target` isn't targeted by the move;
    - Moves now properly check failures against all targets when applicable. If it fails for all targets, it plays the same battle script as before; if it fails for some but not all targets, it will say "It doesn't affect target!", similar to Synchronoise.
    - Additional effects that occur before the move animation (like Brick Break, Spectral Thief), can now be applied to multiple targets and can have a chance to activate.

## 🧪 Test Runner 🧪
### Added
* Adds TIE_BREAK_SCORE and TIE_BREAK_TARGET to test system to allow for forced or random move and target selection by @grintoul1 in [#8398](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/8398)
    - Due to how tests "crash" if the expected move is not what happens in the actual test, the move/target being expected must be the one selected in the **last** run of a test, else the crash causes an animation failure message.
* Adds EXPECT_FAIL macro to test system to allow for testing of conditions correctly triggering failures by @grintoul1 in [#8553](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/8553)
* Capture odds refactor and new catch rate modifiers by @FosterProgramming in [#8682](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/8682)
    - Added new configs for catch rate modifiers: B_INCAPACITATED_CATCH_BONUS, B_LOW_LEVEL_CATCH_BONUS, B_MISSING_BADGE_CATCH_MALUS
    - B_MISSING_BADGE_CATCH_MALUS default config may reduce catch rate in your hack
    - Add new CATCHING_CHANCE macro to the test engine that allow to record the catching chance to more easily test capture parameters

### Changed
* Adds Parabolic Charge spread damage healing test by @AlexOn1ine in [#9094](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/9094)
* Use direct config names instead of enum names by @AsparagusEduardo in [#8824](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/8824)
    - `GetConfig` and `WITH_CONFIG` now use the actual config define. Eg, `B_STURDY` instead of `CONFIG_STURDY`. However, in scripts, using `jumpifgenconfiglowerthan` in scripts would use the full name of `CONFIG_B_STURDY`.
* Added Weight battle tests by @AsparagusEduardo in [#9202](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/9202)

* Refactor pokerus and add configs by @FosterProgramming in [#7731](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/7731)
